Smooth Life is a continous version of Conway's Game of Life where cells live in a floating-point domain. This project visualizes the dynamics inside such game in real-time.

The implementation uses Flask to display the states in a streaming fashion.

## Installation

### Setting Up a Virtual Environment

**With python venv:**

1. Navigate to project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Efesasa0/smooth-life.git
```

2. Create virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv smooth
```

3. Activate it:

```bash
source smooth/bin/activate

```

**With conda**

1. Create conda environment:

```bash
conda create --name smooth python=3.9
```

2. Activate it:

```bash
conda activate smooth

```

### Installing Dependencies

After activating your virtual environment, install the required dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Application
To run the Smooth Life simulation and start the Flask server, execute:

```bash
flask run
```

Then run the solara based app on seperate terminal.

```bash
solara run --theme-variant dark sol.py
```

A window will pop up displaying the interface.

### Challenges

* Get accurate representation of the SmoothLife paper.
* Implement interface with real-time parameter adjustments.
* Initially the scope was only getting the paper implementation. Expanding it to be interacted via user interface was not planned. Major changes for the backend would be nice.

### Extras

* Add additional kernels into calculation can change outcomes drastically.
* Add user interaction feature for real-time parameter adjustments. ‚úÖ
    * Prettify user interface, perhaps reimplement with JS
